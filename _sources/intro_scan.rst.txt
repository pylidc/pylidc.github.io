A quick introduction to the Scan class
======================================

The :class:`pylidc.Scan` class holds some (but not all!) of the DICOM
attributes associated with the CT scans in the LIDC dataset. These attributes
can be used to query the data::

    import pylidc as pl

    # Query for all CT scans with desired traits.
    scans = pl.query(pl.Scan).filter(pl.Scan.slice_thickness <= 1,
                                     pl.Scan.pixel_spacing <= 0.6)
    print(scans.count())
    # => 31

    pid = 'LIDC-IDRI-0078'
    scan = pl.query(pl.Scan).filter(pl.Scan.patient_id == pid).first()

.. note:: Not all of the class attributes are query-able! Some attributes 
    are actually *computed* properties. You can determine this by, for example,
    examining the object type for the class::

        print(type(pl.Scan.slice_thickness))
        # => <class 'sqlalchemy.orm.attributes.InstrumentedAttribute'>
        
        # Meanwhile ...
        print(type(pl.Scan.slice_spacing))
        # => <type 'property'>

    The `slice_thickness` attribute corresponds to the DICOM attribute
    (0018,0050), whereas the `slice_spacing` attribute is computed from 
    the median of spacing between the slices 
    (see :meth:`pylidc.Scan.slice_zvals`).


A :class:`pylidc.Scan` object has zero or more :class:`pylidc.Annotation`
objects, which are radiologist annotations of lung nodules found in the scan::

    print(len(scan.annotations))
    # => 13

    # The scan has 13 annotations, but which refer to the same nodule?
    nods = scan.cluster_annotations()
    print("%s has %d nodules." % (scan, len(nods)))
    # => Scan(id=1,patient_id=LIDC-IDRI-0078) has 4 nodules.
    
    for i,nod in enumerate(nods):
        print("Nodule %d has %d annotations." % (i+1, len(nods[i])))
    # => Nodule 1 has 4 annotations.
    # => Nodule 2 has 4 annotations.
    # => Nodule 3 has 1 annotations.
    # => Nodule 4 has 4 annotations.

The scan can be converted to a NumPy array for image-processing::
    
    ctvol = scan.to_volume()
    print(ctvol.shape)
    # => (512, 512, 87)

An interactive GUI can be engaged, with clustered annotations optionally
indicated with arrows::

    scan.visualize(annotation_groups=nods)
